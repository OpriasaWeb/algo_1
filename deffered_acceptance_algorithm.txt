When writing down the algorithm, you need to be able to refer to any hospital or candidate â€” not only the ones that have been named in the examples. In the pseudocode, H refers to a hospital and K refers to a candidate. As the algorithm progresses H and K will run through all the different hospitals and candidates respectively.

Psuedocode

WHILE any hospital H has an opening and offers to make:
        SET K to H's top candidate
        IF K prefers H to any currently-held offer:
                K REJECTS any current offer they have
                K TENTATIVELY ACCEPTS H as current offer
        ELSE
                K rejects H's offer
        CROSS OFF K from H's list
FINALIZE all tentative matches
